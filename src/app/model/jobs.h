// Background work, and the jobs the user sees running (the footer's
// spinning cog lists them on hover).
//
// The rule: nothing heavy runs on the UI thread. Network calls already
// answer later (net::Client); disk and CPU work — reading a file to upload,
// writing a download, parsing a CSV, building a transcript — goes through
// runInBackground. A job the user waits on (a download, a copy, a forward,
// a summary) also registers with jobs() from the click until it ends, on the
// failure path too:
//
//   const int job = model::jobs().begin(description); // "Downloading report.pdf"
//   … async work …
//   model::jobs().end(job);
//
// Jobs is UI-thread only; runInBackground may be called from it alone too.
