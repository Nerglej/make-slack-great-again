// exportThread — behind the thread panel's

// Registered with model::jobs() ("Downloading thread…") until the file is
// written or the export failed; nothing blocks: the names are resolved on
// the UI thread a slice at a time, the transcript is put together and
// written on a worker (model::runInBackground). The job belongs to nobody:
// it survives the thread panel switching threads or closing. A failed page
// aborts it (no silently truncated file), as does the workspace going away
// before the replies arrive; the reason is logged.
