// RemoteImages — http(s) pictures on disk, for the image caches.
//
// ImageCache (screens/messages) and Avatars (screens/shell) take a path; when
// that path is an http(s) URL they ask this class for a local copy and decode
// the file as they would any other:
//
//   std::string local = remote.cachedPath(url);    // on disk already: use it
//   if (local.empty())
//       remote.fetch(url, [](const std::string &path) { /* "" = failed */ });
//
// Files live in <cacheDir>/images (app/identity.h)/<sha256(url)>, so the same URL is
// downloaded once per machine and survives restarts (the old app's
// WorkspaceCache::saveImage). The directory is bounded by Settings → Storage
// → "Limit cache to" like the old CacheEvictor: least recently used first,
// "used" being the file's mtime (bumped on every cache hit), swept shortly
// after start, every 30 minutes, after 32 MB of new downloads and when the
// limit changes. The other folders the old evictor covered join through
// coverDirs(): the audio player's and the opened HTML files' downloads are
// blobs swept (and cleared) with the pictures; the workspaces' cached data
// counts toward the limit but is never evicted.
//
// Downloads go through the app's one net::Client, at most kMaxParallel at a
// time (the client's 4 workers also carry the Slack API, which must not
// queue behind a channel full of screenshots); the rest wait in order, and a
// URL asked for twice is fetched once. A failed URL (no answer, an error
// status, or bytes that are not an image — Slack's sign-in page instead of a
// file) is not asked for again for kCooldownMs (old ImageCache::markFailed);
// setAuth() forgets those failures, since a workspace signing in is the
// usual cure.
//
// Auth: Slack serves files (files.slack.com) only with the workspace's token
// and, for session auth, its d cookie. The hook the accounts controller sets
// adds them per URL; nothing else here knows about Slack.
//
// Threading: UI thread only. Disk writes, mtime bumps and sweeps run on one
// worker thread; every callback runs later on the UI thread, never inside
// the call that started it.
