// Canvas documents (msga's CanvasPage / CanvasDiff / CanvasDisplay): the
// conversions between the HTML a Slack canvas file serves and the canvas
// markdown it is written back as, and the section diff that turns an edit
// into canvases.edit operations on the sections that changed.
//
// The editor (shell's CanvasPage) holds the markdown's block syntax as text
// ("## ", "- ", "1. ", "> ", "| a | b |") with inline formats; editorHtml
// builds that from the served HTML, markdown() turns it back.
//
// The diff's structural knowledge is msga's (verified against a real
// workspace): top-level <h1..h6 id>, <p id> (code: class="prettyprint"),
// <div data-section-style><ul id>…</ul></div> lists, and <blockquote> /
// <table> whose ids are only on their inner <p>s — those two are "fragile":
// fine as unchanged context, but an edit touching them (or needing one as
// an insert anchor) falls back to replacing the whole document. canvases.edit
// takes one change per call; a section replace reissues the ids inside it, so
// the base must be refetched after every save.
