// Back/forward from a trackpad swipe, the way a browser does it (msga's
// src/ui/swipe_nav.h and swipe_indicator/):
//  - SwipeNav turns one horizontal swipe into one back/forward step. Two-finger
//    swipes are Scroll events: phased on macOS/Wayland, a bare delta stream on
//    Windows/X11 (segmented here by an idle gap). Three-or-more-finger swipes
//    are GestureBegin/Update/End on X11/Wayland and one SwipeGesture on macOS.
//    The direction follows the content: a swipe that drags the view to the
//    right goes back. Each swipe navigates at most once; the rest of its stream
//    is swallowed so the newly opened conversation doesn't inherit it.
//  - SwipeIndicator is the confirmation: a round badge with an arrow that
//    fades in over the message area, drifts a little and fades out.
