// Files an agent made, shown as attachments on the answer that names them.
//
// Claude Code records no list of the files a turn produced: the Write tool is
// one way, but a shell command (an ImageMagick convert, a heredoc) leaves only
// its command line. What an answer does say is where things are — a full path,
// or a folder and the bare names under it ("Files are in /tmp/x/: - a.png").
// So an answer's attachments are the media files it names that were made
// during its turn (modified between the turn's prompt and the answer): a file
// it merely refers to, made earlier, isn't an output.
//
// Each is copied into msga's cache (on a worker) the first time the answer is
// shown, under the session and the answer, so the attachment keeps showing
// what the agent made even after the file is changed or deleted (a job's tmp
// folder goes with the job). The copies go when the session is removed from
// msga. An answer whose named files were none of them made in its turn gets
// an empty index: never looked through again. One that names no file at all
// gets nothing written (most answers): naming none, it never makes any.
//
// An SVG is kept as the file it is (mime image/svg+xml, no size): there is no
// PNG encoder here to render a preview of it.
