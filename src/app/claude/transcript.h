// Claude Code transcript (~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<sessionId>.jsonl) → the
// items msga shows as messages.
//
// The transcript is Claude Code's internal, unversioned format, so this parser
// is deliberately forgiving: unknown record types and fields are skipped, never
// errors. It is fed incrementally (a live transcript is appended to while the
// session runs) and produces exactly the same items whether the file arrives in
// one piece or line by line — item ids (ts) are derived from record timestamps
// plus a per-parser tie-breaker, never from wall-clock time.
//
// What becomes an item:
//   • a typed prompt (user record with string/text content, or a prompt queued
//     mid-turn) → UserPrompt; slash commands are shown as "/name args";
//     task notifications and other system injections are hidden;
//   • what a command Claude Code runs itself prints (/context, /compact) →
//     AssistantText, ending the turn;
//   • Claude Code's "Not logged in" answer → AssistantText marked loginError;
//   • assistant text → AssistantText, marked Progress when the same turn goes on
//     to call tools (no notification for those), Final when the turn ends after
//     it, and Pending while that isn't known yet (the last text of a live turn);
//   • consecutive tool calls → one ToolGroup item (grows as calls arrive);
//   • an Agent/Task call → a Subagent item of its own — it roots a thread holding
//     the subagent's own transcript (subagents/agent-<agentId>.jsonl);
//   • msga's relay of a reply in that thread (subagentReplyPrompt) → a UserPrompt
//     of the reply alone, marked with the subagent it went to (relayTo);
//   • what another agent sent the session (a "peer" turn: a subagent's hand-back
//     of its report, a message from another Claude session) → PeerMessage —
//     Claude Code records it as a user turn, but nobody typed it.
// Thinking, attachments, file-history, cost and mode records are hidden.
