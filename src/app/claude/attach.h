// Types a message into a live background session through its own terminal UI:
// `claude attach <short>` run in a hidden pseudo-terminal, the way a person at
// a terminal would. The message reaches the session without stopping it — so
// a subagent it runs, a background command or a scheduled prompt carries on —
// and arrives as the user's own prompt: answered at once when Claude is idle,
// queued by Claude Code until the next step when it's mid-turn. Stopping and
// resuming (Launcher::resume) would end all of that, and a second process
// can't hand the running one a prompt any other way (verified with Claude Code
// 2.1.282: the cross-session socket delivers a peer's message, not the user's,
// and the daemon's terminal socket is private).
//
// Verified live with 2.1.282, 2026-09-25:
//   • Attaching mirrors the session's screen; several attachers can be on at
//     once (nobody is pushed off), and ending `attach` leaves the session be.
//   • A bracketed paste of more than one line, or of a long line, arrives
//     wrapped in <pasted_content> — which Claude reads as material the user
//     pasted, not what they said. Line by line, a few hundred characters at a
//     time, with a newline (LF) between lines, it arrives exactly as written.
//   • A message starting with "!" switches the prompt to shell mode and runs
//     as a command; one starting with "/" runs a slash command, and some open
//     a panel that keeps the keyboard afterwards. A leading space keeps either
//     plain text — messages meant as slash commands aren't sent this way.
//   • A permission question (the session's own or a subagent's) or a panel
//     takes the prompt box's place and the keyboard: an Enter there answers
//     it. A subagent's question isn't in any state file, so the screen is the
//     only way to know — nothing is typed unless it shows the empty prompt box
//     with the cursor in it (readyForInput).
//
// Lifetime: each runs on its own once started (it holds itself) until it is
// over and `attach` has exited, and the returned handle may be dropped — keep
// a std::weak_ptr to cancel() it later. `done` runs once, on the plat loop;
// a caller that may be gone by then guards it (a shared alive flag). It runs
// at once, from inside the call, when nothing
// could be started (nothing to type, `attach` didn't start) and from cancel().
