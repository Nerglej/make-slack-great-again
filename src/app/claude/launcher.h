// Starts and continues Claude Code sessions as BACKGROUND sessions (`claude --bg`),
// which Claude Code's own daemon runs — so they keep working if msga crashes or
// quits (docs/backend-modules-plan.md §10). Every call is a short-lived CLI
// command (base::run on a worker thread, see async.h); what the session says
// is read from its transcript like any other.
//
// Verified with Claude Code 2.1.282 (2026-09-25):
//   • `--bg` picks its own session id (it ignores --session-id) and prints
//     "backgrounded · <short id>"; the job's state.json holds the full id.
//   • A finished turn leaves the job "done" with its worker still alive, and
//     resuming then only starts a copy — so a follow-up is `claude stop <short>`,
//     wait for the worker's sessions/<pid>.json to go (stop returns before the
//     worker exits, and an idle job keeps reading "done"), then
//     `claude --bg --resume <id> -- <prompt>`.
//   • `claude stop` ends the worker and what runs inside it — subagents,
//     scheduled prompts (CronCreate), a subagent's running command — but not a
//     command Claude ran in the background, which carries on orphaned.
//   • A background session keeps the options it was started with; passing any
//     flag on resume starts a copy instead. A session that was never a
//     background one (a terminal or -p session) takes flags fine.
//   • `--disallowedTools` takes a list, so the prompt must come after `--`.
//   • `--append-system-prompt` is saved with the session like any start option,
//     and the rendered system prompt is recorded in the transcript and sent
//     again on every resume.
//   • `--agents <json>` is saved too (a flag-free resume reports "woke session
//     … with its saved options (… --agents …)"), and its types are offered to
//     the Agent tool next to the built-in ones, each with its own prompt.
//   • `--bg` refuses a folder Claude Code hasn't trusted — since 2.1.289 a git
//     repository's root must be trusted itself, a trusted parent doesn't
//     count. msga records the trust before starting one (see trustFolder).
//   • `claude --bg --resume <id> --fork-session -- <prompt>` branches a session
//     (even one whose worker is alive) into a new background session: its
//     transcript starts with a copy of the original's records, same uuids and
//     timestamps, then the prompt.
//
// Callbacks run on the plat loop, never re-entrantly, and never after the
// Launcher is destroyed — except AttachInput's (see sendLive).
